# FM6126-LED-Matrix-Panel-
Information, drivers and source for FM6126 based LED matrix panels with teh HUB75e connectors.

So many sites with information about LED matrix panels.

Cannot find anyone doing much withthe FM6126 based panels, so I though I would upload anything I have.

I have the panels working with the Mega256, just started looking at the DOIT ESP32 Dev kit V1 device.

If anyone wants to add to this please do any help would be appreciated.

I have found a PDF in German which has a lot of good information.
