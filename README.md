# FM6126-LED-Matrix-Panel

Information, drivers and source for FM6126/FM6124 and ICN2038S based LED matrix panels with the HUB75e connectors.
Panel identification P3-6432-2121-16S-D1.0
Available from Amazon for less than £20 or direct from AliExpress for £13
So many sites with information about LED matrix panels. Cannot find anyone doing much with the FM6126 based panels, so I though I would upload anything I have.

For ESP32 users I would only recommend mrfaptastic's library,  
https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA  
You can have panel sizes greater than 128x128 (2x2) read through his page before going out to buy as there are different types of 
Panels out there. Most panels should work even a mix of panels, if FMxxxx based then use the reset routine.

Kudos goes to
