# FM6126-LED-Matrix-Panel-
Information, drivers and source for FM6126 based LED matrix panels with the HUB75e connectors.

Panel identification P3-6432-2121-16S-D1.0

Available from Amazon for less than £20 or direct from AliExpress for £13

So many sites with information about LED matrix panels.

Cannot find anyone doing much with the FM6126 based panels, so I though I would upload anything I have.

I have the panels working with the Mega256 and the DOIT 30/36/38 Pin ESP32 Dev kit V1 device.

I have found a PDF in German which has a lot of good information.

This library only supports 4096 colours 16x16x16 colours for RGB which should be 4bit

RGB in format 0x0BGR with values 0-15 each channel.

If anyone wants to add to this please do any help would be appreciated.
